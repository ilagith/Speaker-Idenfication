# Introduction

Everyone’s voice has specific characteristics such as pitch timbre or tone, which allow us to recognize anyone’s voice as unique.
The goal of this project is to build a Deep Learning model capable of identifying whether two recordings belong to the same person.  

## The Dataset 

It is a .pkl file, containing voice sequences  and  people ids. Each  sequence  has  11025  points,corresponding to 1 second.
There is more than one sequence with the same id for every id in the set.
